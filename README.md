# Purpose
The purpose of this program is to elaborate on the idea from the python implementation of "ChordQuiz". The python implementation simple reads text files, and prompts each chord on the screen to quiz the user to play them. 

This Java implementation is a proof of concept to the idea of dynamically naming chords given note input. That is, given a set of notes T, what is the chord notation to represent T.

This will of course, be very difficult. Chord representation is difficult without context, and thus, how can an isolated chord be named without context on a complex level (given that basic chords are easily named). Chord naming is already considered arbitrary, thus, the limits of this project are defined by the ability to name chords given a set of notes.
